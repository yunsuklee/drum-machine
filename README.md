# drum-machine
A drum machine app developed with react! 

I tried to make it as 'realistic as possible' with SCSS and responsive as well ;)
Meanwhile with JS, I setted up several configuration buttons which proved very challenging!
First of all, there is a 'power' button which does what you would expect, simply turns on and off the drum.
Secondly, there is a 'display' that shows whatever is being done with the drum.
There's also a volume hanlder and finally a 'bank' button that allows you to choose which sound kit you would like to use :)
The drum contains several pads which you can activate either by clicking or by key pressing and they will trigger a unique sound!

Here's the link to the working app:
